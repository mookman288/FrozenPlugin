				The README included with this development plugin is designed to explain how the system 
				works. While the code is commented and outlines the majority of what can be done, the 
				README provides quite a bit of information on how to leverage this plugin.

				Remember that this plugin is designed to be the base structure for building WordPress 
				plugins. There is so much more that can be created, including shortcodes, media 
				implementation, API integration, licensing, styling with jQuery UI, etc. The only 
				restriction is your imagination. Good luck!
