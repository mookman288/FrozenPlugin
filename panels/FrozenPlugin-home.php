			The README included with this development plugin is designed to explain how the system 
			works. While the code is commented and outlines the majority of what can be done, the 
			README provides quite a bit of information on how to leverage this plugin.

			Remember that this plugin is designed to be the base structure for building WordPress 
			plugins. There is so much more that can be created, including shortcodes, media 
			implementation, API integration, licensing, styling with jQuery UI, etc. The only 
			restriction is your imagination. Good luck!
